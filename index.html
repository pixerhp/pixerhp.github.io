			I don't really have much to put here yet, so this site is mostly just a placeholder for now. (I did learn some html on the spot to do this, which is cool. As the website is pure html, I'm not using anything like CSS yet, thus the padding is a constant pixel value, so I apologize if it makes things look awful on some viewport sizes such as small windows or on mobile.) <br>

			You can find most of my various accounts and important places on my carrd: <a href="https://pixerhp.carrd.co/">(Link to my carrd)</a> <br>
			(In the situation that that somehow becomes a dead link, I'm currently trying to have all of my account usernames everywhere be "pixerhp", so you should probably be able to find me online generally by searching for that on the internet.) <br>
